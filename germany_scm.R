# 1. Confirming the Time Frame
# The 2007–2014 time frame is appropriate for these reasons:

# - Pre-Treatment Period: The pre-treatment period should ideally cover 5–10 years before 2007 to capture stable fertility trends 
# and covariates (e.g., 1995–2006).
# - Post-Treatment Period: Analyzing 2007–2014 avoids overlap with ElterngeldPlus (introduced in 2015), ensuring the evaluation 
# isolates the original Elterngeld policy.
# - Sufficient Post-Treatment Data: The seven-year window provides a reasonable span to detect significant policy impacts on 
# fertility rates.


# 2. Preparing the Data
# 2.1. Dataset Requirements
# Your dataset should include:

# - Unit ID: A unique identifier for each country (e.g., Germany and potential control countries).
# - Time ID: A yearly variable spanning the entire pre-treatment and post-treatment periods (e.g., 1995–2014).
# - Outcome Variable: Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for each country-year.
# - Covariates: Socioeconomic and demographic variables (e.g., GDP per capita, employment rates, female labor force participation, 
# childcare availability, etc.) to account for structural differences.

# 2.2. Donor Pool Selection
# Include structurally similar countries that did not implement policies similar to Elterngeld during the same period 
# (e.g., Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, etc.).
# Exclude countries with overlapping or conflicting fertility policies (e.g., France, Hungary, Poland).


# 3. Implementing GSCM Using gsynth
# 3.1. Install and Load the gsynth Package

# Install and load the package
install.packages("gsynth")
library(gsynth)

# 3.2. Format Your Data
# Ensure the dataset is in long format with columns: unit, time, outcome, and covariates.

# Example data format
head(data)
# unit  time   outcome   gdp_capita  female_labor_force  childcare_spending
# GER   1995   1.38      35000       0.72                5.6
# AUT   1995   1.30      33000       0.69                4.8

# 3.3. Run the GSCM
# The basic syntax for gsynth is as follows:

# Run GSCM
result <- gsynth(
  outcome ~ gdp_capita + female_labor_force + childcare_spending,
  data = data,
  index = c("unit", "time"), # Specify unit and time columns
  force = "two-way",        # Interactive fixed effects model
  EM = TRUE,                # Use matrix completion (Expectation-Maximization)
  CV = TRUE,                # Cross-validation for latent factors
  r = c(0, 5),              # Range of latent factors (adjust if needed)
  se = TRUE,                # Compute standard errors
  nboots = 1000,            # Bootstrap samples for uncertainty estimates
  parallel = TRUE           # Enable parallel computation
)

# 3.4. Plot and Interpret Results

# Plot results
plot(result, type = "gap")    # Treatment effect gaps over time
plot(result, type = "counterfactual") # Observed vs. counterfactual trends

# Summarize results
summary(result)


# 4. Sensitivity Analysis
# 4.1. Robustness to Donor Pool Changes
# Test how results vary by including/excluding certain control countries.

# 4.2. Covariate Selection
# Evaluate the influence of different covariates on pre-treatment fit and post-treatment effects.

# 4.3. Varying Latent Factors
# Experiment with different ranges for latent factors (r parameter) to ensure robustness.


# 5. Interpretation of Results
# Pre-Treatment Fit: Check how well the synthetic Germany matches actual pre-treatment fertility trends. Poor fit suggests model refinements are needed.
# Post-Treatment Impact: The difference between observed and counterfactual outcomes reflects the causal impact of Elterngeld.
# Placebo Tests: Perform placebo tests by assigning "treatment" to control units to verify that observed effects are not due to chance.
