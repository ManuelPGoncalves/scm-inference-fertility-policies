# Assessing the Impact of Parental Allowance on Fertility: A Synthetic Control Study of Germany

## Context:
Germany’s declining fertility rates have been a persistent demographic challenge, prompting policy interventions aimed at encouraging higher birth rates. One such intervention is the parental allowance (Elterngeld), introduced in 2007, designed to provide financial support to parents during the first months of a child’s life. While studies have examined its effects on labor market participation and fertility rates, the magnitude and causal nature of its impact on fertility remain contested. This policy offers an opportunity to investigate the interplay between family support measures and demographic changes in high-income countries.


## Research gap and objectives:
Existing literature on the impact of family policies on fertility often relies on regression-based approaches or descriptive analyses, which may fail to establish causal relationships or control for external confounding factors. Few studies employ advanced causal inference techniques, such as synthetic control methods, to quantify the policy's specific impact.

This research aims to:
- Quantify the causal effect of Germany’s parental allowance on fertility rates.
- Compare Germany’s fertility trends with a synthetic control group of similar European countries that did not implement equivalent policies.
- Contribute to the broader discussion on the effectiveness of family policies in addressing demographic challenges in developed economies.


## Methodological approach:
The synthetic control method (SCM) will be applied to estimate the causal impact of Elterngeld on fertility rates. SCM creates a weighted combination of comparison countries to construct a “synthetic Germany” that mirrors its pre-2007 fertility trends. This synthetic counterpart serves as a counterfactual to Germany’s actual fertility rates post-policy implementation.

Key steps include:
- Data collection: Fertility rates, socio-economic indicators, and policy variables from Germany and potential donor pool countries from 1990 to 2020.
- Model construction: Using SCM to match pre-treatment fertility trends and determine the divergence post-2007.
- Robustness checks: Placebo tests and sensitivity analyses to validate findings.

## Expected results and contributions:
The study is expected to demonstrate whether and to what extent the parental allowance influenced fertility rates in Germany. Findings will offer:
- Empirical evidence for policymakers on the efficacy of financial incentives in reversing fertility decline.
- Methodological insights into the use of SCM for evaluating demographic policies.
- Broader relevance for countries facing similar demographic challenges, providing a framework for assessing family policies in other contexts.
This research will bridge gaps in existing literature by providing a causal analysis of Germany’s parental allowance, contributing to both academic scholarship and practical policymaking.
